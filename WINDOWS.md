### 3. Configure Backend Settings

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash

   ```

2. Copy the default config file and fill in the necessary settings:

   copy .env.default .env
   copy Rocket.default.toml Rocket.toml
   ```

   **.env:**

   ```env
   PASSWORD=password
   SYNC_PATH=./upload
   DISCORD_HOOK_URL=
   ```

   _Explanation:_

   - `PASSWORD`: Your password for the app.
   - `SYNC_PATH`: List of directories that the app will watch for new or modified photos.
   - `DISCORD_HOOK_URL`: (Optional) Fill in your Discord webhook URL to receive error notifications.

   **Rocket.toml:**

   - `port`: Default is `5673`. You can change this to your desired port number.

### 4. Build the Backend

Navigate to `gallery-backend` and build the backend using Cargo:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### 5. Configure Frontend Settings

   ```bash
   cd ./Urocissa/gallery-frontend
   ```

2. Copy the default frontend config file:

   ```bash
   copy config.default.ts config.ts
   ```

   **Note:** The `config.ts` file contains advanced settings. You can leave it unchanged unless you need to customize it.

```bash
npm run build
```
