## Steps to Set Up and Use the App (Windows Version)

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Urocissa app on a Windows machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, ensure that you have Git for Windows installed. Then clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hsa00000/Urocissa.git
```

This will create a folder called `./Urocissa`.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure the following software is installed on your system:

- **ffmpeg**: Download FFmpeg from the official [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Extract the downloaded folder, and add the `bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

- **Rust**: Install Rust using the [official installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for Windows.

### 3. Configure Backend Settings

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   copy Rocket.default.toml Rocket.toml
   ```

   **.env:**

   ```env
   PASSWORD=password
   SYNC_PATH=./upload
   DISCORD_HOOK_URL=
   ```

   _Explanation:_

   - `PASSWORD`: Your password for the app.
   - `SYNC_PATH`: List of directories that the app will watch for new or modified photos.
   - `DISCORD_HOOK_URL`: (Optional) Fill in your Discord webhook URL to receive error notifications.

   **Rocket.toml:**

   - `port`: Default is `5673`. You can change this to your desired port number.
